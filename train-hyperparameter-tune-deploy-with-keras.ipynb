    "# Training, hyperparameter tune, and deploy with Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to train a simple deep neural network using the MNIST dataset and Keras on Azure Machine Learning. MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a handwritten digit of `28x28` pixels, representing number from 0 to 9. The goal is to create a multi-class classifier to identify the digit each image represents, and deploy it as a web service in Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the MNIST dataset, please visit [Yan LeCun's website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisite:\n",
    "* Understand the [architecture and terms](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture) introduced by Azure Machine Learning\n",
    "* If you are using an Azure Machine Learning Notebook VM, you are all set. Otherwise, go through the [configuration notebook](../../../configuration.ipynb) to:\n",
    "    * install the AML SDK\n",
    "    * create a workspace and its configuration file (`config.json`)\n",
    "* For local scoring test, you will also need to have `tensorflow` and `keras` installed in the current Jupyter kernel."

    "1. Preparing: A docker image is created matching the Python environment specified by the TensorFlow estimator and it will be uploaded to the workspace's Azure Container Registry. This step will only happen once for each Python environment -- the container will then be cached for subsequent runs. Creating and uploading the image takes about **5 minutes**. While the job is preparing, logs are streamed to the run history and can be viewed to monitor the progress of the image creation.\n",

    "2. Scaling: If the compute needs to be scaled up (i.e. the AmlCompute cluster requires more nodes to execute the run than currently available), the cluster will attempt to scale up in order to make the required amount of nodes available. Scaling typically takes about **5 minutes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Running: All scripts in the script folder are uploaded to the compute target, data stores are mounted/copied and the `entry_script` is executed. While the job is running, stdout and the `./logs` folder are streamed to the run history and can be viewed to monitor the progress of the run.\n",

    "4. Post-Processing: The `./outputs` folder of the run is copied over to the run history\n",

    "### Warm start a Hyperparameter Tuning experiment and resuming child runs\n",
    "Often times, finding the best hyperparameter values for your model can be an iterative process, needing multiple tuning runs that learn from previous hyperparameter tuning runs. Reusing knowledge from these previous runs will accelerate the hyperparameter tuning process, thereby reducing the cost of tuning the model and will potentially improve the primary metric of the resulting model. When warm starting a hyperparameter tuning experiment with Bayesian sampling, trials from the previous run will be used as prior knowledge to intelligently pick new samples, so as to improve the primary metric. Additionally, when using Random or Grid sampling, any early termination decisions will leverage metrics from the previous runs to determine poorly performing training runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning allows you to warm start your hyperparameter tuning run by leveraging knowledge from up to 5 previously completed hyperparameter tuning parent runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there might be occasions when individual training runs of a hyperparameter tuning experiment are cancelled due to budget constraints or fail due to other reasons. It is now possible to resume such individual training runs from the last checkpoint (assuming your training script handles checkpoints). Resuming an individual training run will use the same hyperparameter configuration and mount the storage used for that run. The training script should accept the \"--resume-from\" argument, which contains the checkpoint or model files from which to resume the training run. You can also resume individual runs as part of an experiment that spends additional budget on hyperparameter tuning. Any additional budget, after resuming the specified training runs is used for exploring additional configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on warm starting and resuming hyperparameter tuning runs, please refer to the [Hyperparameter Tuning for Azure Machine Learning documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-tune-hyperparameters) \n",
